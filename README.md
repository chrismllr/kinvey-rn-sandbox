# `kinvey-react-native-sdk` Sandbox

Sandbox to test functionalities of the [kinvey-react-native sdk](https://github.com/dialexa/kinvey-react-native-sdk)

This app is built using `create-react-native-app` & Expo. For any questions concerning the app build, reference the [CRNA_README](./CRNA_README.md).

## Development
To set up the development environment, first install dependencies:
```
yarn
```

Then, start the dev server:
```
yarn start
```

This will provide a QR code to open via the Expo app, or tap `i` to run in the iOS Simulator.
